========
Overview
========

There are two ways to install and use Johnny:
1. Use a prebuilt redistributable packge (Windows and OS X only for now)
2. Download source and build yourself (all platforms)

As Johnny requires John The Ripper to do the actual work, the first step is to
get the latest John The Ripper binary for your platform. Official core version
or community-enhanced version (jumbo) are both supported. You can grab JtR from:
http://www.openwall.com/john/.

To get access to all new features and bugfixes (particularly on Windows), you should
use JtR >= 1.8.0.6-jumbo-1. On Windows, JtR must be build with Cygwin and have the
appropriate DLLs in its folder. As a rule of thumb, if you can't run JtR from the
Windows command line without error, some DLLs are missing. They can be found in Cygwin/bin.

Assuming that John The Ripper is installed on your system, the next step is
to install Johnny.

================
Windows and OS X
================

Simply visit http://openwall.info/wiki/john/johnny to get the latest installer
for the latest versions of the respective platforms.

If you want to use Johnny on Linux/BSD flavors or obsolete versions of OS X and
Windows, you can build Johnny from source or look for it in your distribution's
official repos.

============
FreeBSD 10.1
============

1) pkg install git qt5-core qt5-widgets qt5-qmake qt5-buildtools
2) git clone https://github.com/shinnok/johnny.git && cd johnny
3) git checkout v2.2 # switch to the desired version
4) /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
5) Edit the resulted Makefile and append ",-L,/usr/local/lib" to the LFLAGS line. Somehow
the clang++ spec of qmake ommits that on FreeBSD. The complete line should look like this:
LFLAGS        = -pthread -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib,-L,/usr/local/lib
6) make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
7) ./johnny

====================
Debian based distros
====================

These steps apply to all the Debian (included) based flavors such as Ubuntu,
Mint etc.

1) sudo apt-get install g++ git qtbase5-dev
2) git clone https://github.com/shinnok/johnny.git && cd johnny
3) git checkout v2.2 # switch to the desired version
4) export QT_SELECT=qt5
5) qmake && make -j$(nproc)
6) ./johnny

=====================
Red Hat based distros
=====================

1) sudo yum install gcc-c++ git qt5-qtbase-devel
2) git clone https://github.com/shinnok/johnny.git && cd johnny
3) git checkout v2.2 # switch to the desired version
4) qmake-qt5 && make -j$(nproc)
5) ./johnny

On any platform, if you prefer building using an IDE or are planning to get
involved with Johnny development, you can download the Qt Creator at
http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/ and open the project file
johnny.pro.

=====
OS X
=====

Assuming that you have already built and installed John The Ripper,
you must have already configured your system for development. As a minimum requirement
for Qt development you'll need to install install Xcode and the Xcode command line tools.

Then you need to install the proper Qt 5 SDK via one of the following means:
* Via the Qt Online Installer from https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
* Via Homebrew from http://brew.sh (use command "brew install qt5")

Assuming you survived up until now, let's proceed to the actual steps for
building the app for your system:

1) git clone https://github.com/shinnok/johnny.git && cd johnny
2) git checkout v2.2 # switch to the desired version
3) qmake # /usr/local/opt/qt5/bin/qmake for Homebrew
4) make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
5) open ./johnny.app

Optionally, if you want to install the app on your system:
6) cp -r ./johnny.app /Applications/
