Compiling on Unix/Linux and Windows
-----------------------------------

Prerequisites:
   * Qt 4.7.0 or later
   * On Linux you have two choices for installing the Qt SDK:
        1. Install Qt 4.7.0 or later using your distribution's
            package manager. The minimum libraries you need are
            libqt4-core, libqt4-gui and libqt4-dev. Besides that
            you will need qt4-qmake for qmake and g++/libstdc++5, 
            though these should be automatically installed as 
            dependencies to libqt*.
            For e.g. on debian you can:
            apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-gui libqt4-dev
            and say yes to the dependencies and you get everything
            you need.
        2. Install the latest official Qt SDK available at:
            http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
   * On Windows:
     -  MinGW 4.4 or later, Visual Studio 2008 or later
     -  jom
     The Qt SDK provides you with most of the required software.
     Grab the official Qt SDK from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
     -  open an instance of Qt SDK Command Prompt

Building:

cd ncgui/
qmake netcatqui.pro
make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

To clean the build directory:
make clean && make distclean
